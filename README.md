⚡ Power Electronics Simulations
As part of my research interest in power electronics, this repository contains circuit simulations for various power converters, including:

🔌 AC-DC Converters

🔋 DC-DC Converters

🔁 DC-AC Converters

🔄 AC-AC Converters


🛠️ Simulations Overview
These simulations are built using MATLAB Simulink in the initial stage. The repository will be progressively updated with more complex simulations, such as:

⭐ Multiphase Star Rectifiers

⚡ PWM Inverters

📉 Device Characteristics Analysis

🤖 Power Electronics with Machine Learning Projects
